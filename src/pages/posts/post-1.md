I am honored to represent the resilient spirit and vibrant culture of Haiti as I run for the Miss Choucoune International pageant.

Amidst the challenges we face, this pageant stands as a source of hope, illuminating the beauty, grace and resiliency that define us.

My journey in this pageant is fueled by a profound commitment to Empowerher Health—a platform that transcends borders to champion the well-being of women.
In our nurturing essence, we often place the needs of others above our own, neglecting our fundamental right to self-care.
As pillars of society, we carry the weight of countless responsibilities, yet it is necessary that we prioritize our physical, mental, and emotional health.

Miss Choucoune is inspired by a love song to a beautiful marabout, which term describes the offspring of a haitian person with mixed race.
A woman who knew her worth and refused to be caged by the love of an unfaithful man. She was a free bird who prioritized her independence.
She was fluid and firm, graceful and stern. As she seemed to have been ahead of her time, we should strive to embody her resilient soul.

Through Empowerher Health, I aspire to foster a culture of self-love and empowerment, where every woman feels deserving of care and attention.
Together, we will shatter the barriers that inhibit our pursuit of wellness, paving the way for a future where women stand tall in their strength and vitality.

My vision for Empowerher Health extends beyond individual transformation—it encompasses a collective movement towards holistic well-being.
By amplifying our voices and advocating for accessible healthcare resources, we will dismantle systemic inequities that perpetuate disparities in women's health.

I am privileged to showcase the resilience and grace in the Haitian culture. With each step I take on this journey,
I carry the hopes and dreams of my beloved nation, striving to inspire the heart of women worldwide.

Together, let us celebrate the beauty of diversity, the power of unity, and the unwavering strength of the female spirit.
